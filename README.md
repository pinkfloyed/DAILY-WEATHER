## Daily Weather Timer
1. Simple web application that fetches data from a public API and displays it dynamically on a webpage.
2. Daily weather application using html, css, javascript and an API key that allows to fetch weather information from a weather API service and display it to users in user-friendly way.
3. Error Handling and Performance Optimization also evaluated.
   (a) If the fetch request fails (if the city is not found or there is a network issue), an error message is displayed to the user.
   (b) The error container is created only when an error occurs, reducing unnecessary DOM manipulation.![login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/338d73bf-b802-4f52-aa62-48cdd912937c)
